/*

Objective:
Practice using the .length property by calculating the length of
multiple predefined strings and assigning the results to specific variables.

Instructions:
You will be provided with several predefined string variables.
Your task is to:
  - Use the .length property to calculate the length of each string.
  - Assign the length of each string to its corresponding length variable.
  - Ensure that each length variable contains the correct value.

// Starter Code (Pre-filled):
// Predefined strings
let stringOne = "Coding Bootcamp";
let stringTwo = "JavaScript";
let stringThree = "";

// Assign the length of each string to the corresponding variable
let lengthOne = stringOne.length;     // "Coding Bootcamp" has 15 characters
let lengthTwo = stringTwo.length;     // "JavaScript" has 10 characters
let lengthThree = stringThree.length; // "" is an empty string, so it has 0 characters

// Print to check answers
console.log("Length of stringOne:", lengthOne);   // 15
console.log("Length of stringTwo:", lengthTwo);   // 10
console.log("Length of stringThree:", lengthThree); // 0
